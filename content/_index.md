heading2_sub: "It's important for your business to have software that is efficient, viable, and can grow and evolve with your company. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software like Excel or Microsoft Office are commercialized packages that target a broad set of needs and ultimately will let you down. Custom software development is like getting a precisely cut and tailored suit - it's created to great look great on YOU and meet your specific set of requirements.<br><br>Custom Software Development is the process of designing, deploying, and maintaining software for a specific user or organization in mind. Instead of having to continually fiddle with COTS applications to adjust them to your needs, a custom process supports your processes from the beginning. Not only that, but it's designed to be scalable. With a COTS, your growth could be held back by limited software. Custom software anticipates that your business, as well as the market, will grow and change and incorporates systems to evolve with you. It ensures that the software remains effective by verifying your system receives the proper installations, updates, performance and availability optimization, and service desk functions."
